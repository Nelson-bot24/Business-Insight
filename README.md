## Problem Statement :
AtliQ Hardware, a leading consumer electronics company, operates globally with a diverse customer base, similar to well-known brands like HP and Dell. While AtliQ Hardware has been experiencing rapid growth, it has encountered challenges in the Latin American market. These challenges stem from their reliance on Excel files for data management. Excel, although versatile, presents difficulties in terms of data comprehension, visualization capabilities, and scalability. These limitations have led to significant losses in the Latin American market." To address this, our objective is to implement an advanced analytics solution to enable efficient data analysis and drive informed decision-making.
